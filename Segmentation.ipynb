    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Table contents in Pinot are expected to grow infinitely and thus need to be distributed across multiple nodes. Therefore, the tables' dataset is split into segments, which are comparable to shards/partitions in classical RDBMSs. In Pinot, segmentation is done in a time-based fashion, meaning that records in a given segment will be timewisely close to each other.\n",
    "Segments store all columns of a table and organize data in columnar orientation for high encoding efficiency and optional pre-aggregation of metrics. In addition to the data itself, segments contain indices and other lookup-related data structures like dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Pinot is not a general-purpose database (data is immutable), it cannot be used as an application's \"main datastore\". Like other OLAP stores, Pinot is supposed to run next to the application's \"main datastore\" and its data has to be imported seperately (ingestion). In order to facilitate near-realtime analytical queries, for example like the ones powering LinkedIn's well-known \"Who viewed my profile\" functionality, data is typically ingested into Pinot via event streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka (stream ingestion). In contrast to classical RDBMSs, Pinot comes with built-in support for directly reading from Kafka event streams.\n",
    "However, data can also be ingested from traditional batch processing workflows, for example realized with Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark (batch ingestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinot tables are either \"realtime\" tables or \"offline\" tables. Tables of both types are broken into segments. For realtime tables, data is consumed directly from event streams by Pinot servers as-is without any additional processsing. Segments are built inside Pinot and are completed once a given threshold in size or time is reached. Segments for offline tables are built outside of Pinot in batch processing jobs, that might perform additional data deduplication or similar processing, and uploaded to the Pinot controller. Both table types might be combined to form \"hybrid\" tables, that allow both realtime analytics as well as long-term data storage (covered later on)."

    "To demonstrate how segments work in Pinot, we're going to focus on realtime data ingestion first. In the following examples, we'll be using the controller's and broker's REST APIs in order to dynamically create realtime tables, retrieve segment metadata and execute SQL queries."

    "Pinot brokers are responsible for executing queries against the database. When a broker receives a new query, it sends multiple subqueries to Pinot servers that are hosting the segments belonging to the queried table. Once it has received results from all queried servers, it merges the subresults and returns the aggregated result to the client.\n",
    "In order to efficiently execute queries, brokers use segment metadata to figure out, which segments need to be queried. For example, if we want to list the top 5 drivers in terms of trips count in a given timeframe, only the segments hosting data of the timeframe need to be queried.\n",
    "\n",

In the returned query statistics we can see, that not all segments of the table (`numSegmentsQueried`) are actually process, but only 2 of them (`numSegmentsMatched`). This is because the last (the consuming) segment is always queried, because the metadata is not yet completed, thus the broker can't tell upfront, if it might contain relevant data."

However, Pinot offers much more advanced configuration options for tweaking segment replication, availability and placement in large-scale Pinot clusters.\n",

    "For example, Pinot servers can be grouped in so called \"replica groups\", that can be spread across different availability zones. Segment replicas will then be assigned to servers in different replica groups in order to achieve high-availability setups. Furthermore, segments can be partitioned based on column values in order to furhter increase query performance by decreasing the number of segments that need to be processed for a given query. This is very similar to partitioning/sharding in typical RDBMSs.\n",

    "\n",
    "While offline tables can be used standalone similar to the realtime tables presented above, a more interesting option is to combine both an offline and realtime table to form a hybrid table.\n",
    "Hybrid tables are comprised of two individual tables, one offline table and one hybrid table, both sharing the same name, schema and – most importantly – time column. The hybrid table can be queried just like any other table, but the broker will transparently rewrite queries to fetch older records from the offline table and newer records from the realtime table.\n",
    "This allows to process, deduplicate and sanitize records before pushing them to long-term storage. This is a key differentiator between Pinot and other databases and OLAP stores and allows Pinot to achieve high-throughput ingestion, low-latency realtime analytics, while still allowing to backfill data in batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since version `0.6.0` Pinot also offers a mechanism to regularly move records from a realtime table to the corresponding offline table. To configure this, the user can schedule a task, which should be executed on a minion instance for example once every day.
