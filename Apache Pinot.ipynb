    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pinot cluster is comprised of multiple distributed components. Each Pinot cluster consists of a controller, one or multiple brokers and multiple servers. Pinot supports multi-tenancy out-of-the-box, as multiple brokers and servers can be assigned to serve specific tenants. A table in pinot consists of columns and rows, which are broken horizontally into shards (named segments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Helix is a generic cluster management framework which is used for automatic management of partitioned and replicated distributed systems by creating and assigning tasks. Apache Zookeeper takes care of coordination and maintenance of the overall cluster state and health. In addition, it stores information about the cluster like server locations of a segment and table schema information. The Controller embeds the Helix agent and is the driver of the cluster. To access CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations on logical storage resources, it provides a REST interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a client wants to query data of Pinot tables, the request will be sent to the broker. It routes queries to the appropriate server instances and keeps track on the query routing tables. These routing tables consist of a mapping between segments and server, where the segments reside on. This ensures the right routing of the query to the correct segment. Segments can either consume realtime data or data can be pushed into offline segments. By default, the query load is balanced across all available servers. The broker will return one consolidated result to the client, independent from the fact whether the table is divided into realtime and offline segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Servers are categorized into offline and realtime servers. According to this categorization, servers in Pinot either host offline or realtime data. The responsibility of a server is defined by the table assignment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new realtime table is configured, the realtime server will start consuming data from the streaming source (e.g. Kafka topic). The broker will watch the consumption, detect new segments and maintain them in the query routing list. If a segment has been completed (reached a specific amount of records or was available for a specific timeframe), the controller will upload the segment to the cluster's segment store. The status of the uploaded segment changes from \"consuming\" to \"online\" and the controller will start a new consumption on the realtime server.\n",
    "With batch ingestion, already existing data (e.g. in Hadoop) can be loaded to a Pinot table. "

In our scenario, the parameter `pinot.broker.enable.query.limit.override` is set to false, which means that the broker won't override or add a query limit when the returned record amount is larger than defined in the broker config file."

    "## Key differences to well-known database technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pinot, data ingestion is append-only. There is no possibility to modify values after ingestion by doing operations like `UPDATE` known from databases like PostgreSQL. Pinot is no replacement for databases in an operational business environment, which usually require updates to data because of the event's nature or due to data correction. For this use cases, Pinot does not fit. Instead, it can enhance use cases requiring fast analytics. However, data can still be purged after ingestion for fullfilling compliance requirements (e.g. GDPR). For this, the Minion can be used to replace entire segments, but in no case, single records can be manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference of Apache Pinot compared to databases like PostgreSQL is that it doesn't support queries requiring movements of large amounts of data between the nodes, like joins. The query engine Presto can be used to join different tables in Pinot, but Presto needs to be set up additionally and is not part of Pinot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables in Pinot typically have one primary time column, which is used to manage the time boundary between offline and realtime data in a hybrid table. This may sound familiar to the known concept of time series databases like Influxdb. Both databases are built to handle events with a timestamp, but the timestamp in Pinot is only strictly required for hybrid tables. In addition, Pinot is not only focused on storing timeseries of metrics, it also offers to storm string and bytes values in addition to numeric data types and date time fields. Although Influxdb also support strings to a specific extend, Pinot also offers e.g. text indexing for enhanced full text search.\n",
    "Compared to the timeseries databases like Influxdb, Pinot is optimized for storing time data with a focus on append operations and queries. Update and delete operations on single records are not supported in Apache Pinot, though stream ingestion supports upserts, if a primary key has been defined in the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference of Pinot in comparison to other distributed databases is the heterogeneous nature of its components. Some traditional RDBMSs like for example PostgreSQL can be scaled horizontally to form a cluster by adding more instances, that will each store and manage different partitions (shards) of the dataset. In this case, such a distributed setup is comprised of only a single stateful component, which is started on multiple machines (homogeneous distributed system).\n",
    "In contrast to this, a Pinot cluster is comprised of multiple heterogeneous components (described above), which each serve a specific purpose and are only responsible for a given subtask of the entire system. For example, servers are the stateful components of Pinot, that store and query the actual dataset, while brokers are stateless components, that don't host data themselves and only serve the query frontend for the database. With this, Pinot can be seen as a heterogeneous distributed system, which makes it more complex to deploy and operate, but also serves the key requirements described above (mainly horizontal scalability and fault tolerance)."

    "- DateTime columns: represent timestamps of records. One DataTime column can be treated as the primary time column, which is defined in the segment config of a table.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Table contents in Pinot are expected to grow infinitely and thus need to be distributed across multiple nodes. Therefore, the tables' dataset is split into segments, which are comparable to shards/partitions in classical RDBMSs. In Pinot, segmentation is done in a time-based fashion, meaning that configured timestamps of records in a given segment will be close to each other.\n",
    "Segments store all columns of a table and organize data in columnar orientation for high encoding efficiency and optional pre-aggregation of metrics. In addition to the data itself, segments contain indices and other lookup-related data structures like dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Pinot is not a general-purpose database (data is immutable), it cannot be used as an application's \"main datastore\". Like other OLAP stores, Pinot is supposed to run next to the application's \"main datastore\" and its data has to be imported separately (ingestion). In order to facilitate near-realtime analytical queries, for example like the ones powering LinkedIn's well-known \"Who viewed my profile\" functionality, data is typically ingested into Pinot via event streaming platforms, like Apache Kafka (stream ingestion). In contrast to classical RDBMSs, Pinot comes with built-in support for directly reading from Kafka event streams.\n",
    "However, data can also be ingested from traditional batch processing workflows, for example realized with Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark (batch ingestion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinot tables are either defined as realtime or offline tables. Tables of both types are broken into segments. For realtime tables, data is consumed directly from event streams by Pinot servers as-is without any additional processing. Segments are built inside Pinot and are completed once a given threshold in size or time is reached. Segments for offline tables are built outside of Pinot in batch processing jobs, that might perform additional data deduplication or similar processing, and uploaded to the Pinot controller. Both table types might be combined to form hybrid tables, that allow both realtime analytics as well as long-term data storage (covered later on)."

Once it has received results from all queried servers, it merges the subresults and returns the aggregated result to the client.\n",

In the returned query statistics we can see, that not all segments of the table (`numSegmentsQueried`) are actually processed, but only 2 of them (`numSegmentsMatched`). This is because the last (the consuming) segment is always queried, as the metadata is not yet completed and so the broker can't tell upfront, if the last segment might contain relevant data."

However, Pinot offers much more advanced configuration options for tweaking segment replication, availability and placement in large-scale Pinot clusters.\n",

    "For example, Pinot servers can be grouped in so called \"replica groups\", that can be spread across different availability zones. Segment replicas will then be assigned to servers in different replica groups in order to achieve high-availability setups. Furthermore, segments can be partitioned based on column values to further increase query performance by decreasing the number of segments that need to be processed for a given query. This is very similar to partitioning/sharding in typical RDBMSs.\n",

    "As mentioned earlier, Pinot also support ingesting data from batch processing jobs. For offline tables, the same principles apply as for realtime tables with regards to segmentation and query routing. \n",
    "Though, segments are compiled and packaged outside Pinot. For this purpose, Pinot offers different mechanisms to load pre-built segments from object stores (such as S3) or HDFS or to build new segments using Hadoop and/or Spark.\n",
    "Segments are packaged as gzipped tar-archives (including data, index maps, column statistics) and can be uploaded to and downloaded from the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "While offline tables can be used standalone similar to the realtime tables presented above, a more interesting option is to combine an offline and a realtime table to form a hybrid table.\n",
    "Hybrid tables are comprised of two individual tables, one offline table and one hybrid table, both sharing the same name, schema and – most importantly – time column. The hybrid table can be queried just like any other table, but the broker will transparently rewrite queries to fetch older records from the offline table and newer records from the realtime table.\n",
    "This allows to process, deduplicate and sanitize records before pushing them to long-term storage. This is a key differentiator between Pinot and other databases and OLAP stores. It allows Pinot to achieve high-throughput ingestion, low-latency realtime analytics, while still allowing to backfill data in batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since version `0.6.0` Pinot also offers a mechanism to regularly move records from a realtime table to the corresponding offline table. To configure this, the user can schedule a task, which should be executed on a minion instance for example once every day.

The top two records of the result data set are displayed once to get an insight into the result. Additionally, the function will create a `DataFrame` listing query execution statistics for each table. Metrics of one query execution will only be appended to the `DataFrame` if no exception occurs."

    "The main metrics of a query execution we will check are:\n",
    "- __timeUsedMs__: Total time between broker receiving the query request request and sending the response back to the client.\n",
    "- __numDocScanned__: Number of documents/records scanned while query processing. (Includes records scanned in the filter phase as well as after applying the filter.)\n",
    "- __numEntriesScannedInFilter__: It is an indicator of the latency contributed by the lookup phase. If this number is high, applying an index on the selection criteria might improve performance, especially if the selection criteria is highly selective.\n",
    "- __numEntriesScannedPostFilter__: High number is an indicator for low selectivity. Instead of regular indices, a star-tree index could help."

    "For the tables create above, we configured the following index types:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Forward Index__\n",
    "- __Default Index: Dictionary-encoded forward index with bit compression__: \n",
    "    Apache Pinot will use this index by default for each column if no other index is configured in the table configuration. An id is assigned to each distinct value of the column, afterwards a dictionary is built matching an id to the value. In the forward index, only the bit-compressed id is persisted instead of the values. This compression improves space efficiency of the storage, if there are only a few distinct values.\n",

    "- __Raw Value Forward Index__: A raw value forward index is configured as a `noDictionaryColumn` in the table configuration. Instead of dictionary ids, the raw values will be stored in columns. Because of that, no dictionary lookup is required and due to the locality of values the performance of scanning large number of values is improved. \n",
    "- __Sorted forward index with run-length encoding__: The sorted forward index is applied on top of the dictionary-encoding. For each dictionary id, a start and end document id is stored. Only one sorted column can be configured per table.\n",
    "   \n",
    "__Inverted Index__: Inverted Indexes reduce the number of records which need be processed by identifying the ones which contain the search term. The inverted index is created by selecting all distinct values of a given column. For each value, a list of document ids which contain the value will be stored. If we search e.g. for \"Hessen\" as a state, we can look up the inverted index for \"Hessen\" and identify the documents in which that value appears. \n",
    "- __Bitmap inverted index__: A map from each value to a bitmap is maintained for the column which is enabled as bitmap inverted index (e.g. \"Thüringen\" -> `Doc5, Doc1`). If a column is used frequently for filtering, an inverted index will improve the performance. \n",

This can significantly improve query performance for hierarchical data (e.g. groups of users, workspaces, or states of locations in the `trips` example), on the other hand pre-aggregation requires also more disk space (table size can easily grow about twice of the size as the other tables).\n",

    "### Indexes - Comparison with other database technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Two categories of the indexing options demonstrated above, that can also be found in traditional databases, are Forward Indexes and Inverted Indexes.\n",
    "Forward Indexes are frequently used in traditional database technologies as well to improve storage efficiency.\n",
    "Search Engines most often rely on a inverted index, like for example EleasticSearch.\n",
    "We saw, that there is a special index to do a fulltext search for records containing a specific string.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also demonstrated two other indexing techniques, that are typically not offered by traditional database systems: raw value forward index and Star-Tree index.\n",
    "The raw value forward index doesn't include dictionaries - when aggregating a large number of values, it can take advantage of data locality for scanning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Star-Tree Index is an important and special concept for Pinot, because it is utilizes pre-aggregation for group-by queries to achieve low query latencies. It is specifically designed for the analytical use cases which Pinot was built for and makes it a a key differenciator of Pinot.\n",
    "E.g. Star-Tree Indexes can bring great benefits, if there is the requirement to return data e.g. per user level - like it is the case for the \"Who viewed my Profile\" application at LinkedIn."

    "# Closing Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to most other common databases, setting up Pinot is more complicated as multiple different components are part of a Pinot cluster.\n",
    "The several different components ensure the flexible scale up of the cluster and the high availability, as the system would continue to serve queries also if in the event of one node going down. This is a big advantage, but the different components also add more operational complexity to the whole landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "We experienced the advantages of Pinot, e.g. the possibility to easily stream a high number of data records from a Kafka topic into a table with high throughput. Of course, our experience doesn’t represent a use case like how LinkedIn is using Pinot, as we are producing data for the Kafka stream only once - there is no continuous data stream to the Pinot tables. For demonstration purposes, we wait for the data stream to finish loading to ensure, that there are enough data records for our analysis. In a real scenario, you would operate and execute queries while data is ingested.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Pinot is not a general-purpose database like for example PostgreSQL, but is rather highly-specialized database technology. It is definitely more complex to operate and understand, but offers great values for the specific use cases it was built for: near-realtime analytics of huge datasets. Especially the segmentation of tables, hybrid table queries and specialized indexing options contribute to Pinot's extreme scalability, flexibility and performance."
